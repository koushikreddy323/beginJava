Access Modifiers specifies the accessibility of the class,method,constructor. When we change the access level then the accessibility of methods,classes also changes.
Public    - Can access within and outside of class and package.
Private   - Can access within class.
Default   - Can access within class and package.
Protected - Can access within package and to use outside package the class should be inherited.
             Ex:
                package A
                class A1{
                int n=10;
                }

                Package B
                import A;
                class B1 extends A1{
                sout(n);
                }.
